### About Our App: The RhiZone
RhiZone is an anonymous social media website that promotes a space for users of the Internet to engage freely in discussions, particularly in topics surrounding the liberal arts that are significant and intellectual. Anonymity is key to our website: it prevents users from feeling judged while posting and allows them to speak their thoughts honestly, thereby avoiding other problems with having a so-called identity.

### Features for Regular Users
Regular users can create new threads and post about issues related to literature, film, music, philosophy, etc. but they must do so anonymously. They are also able to receive notifications on their inbox from activities in threads that they post and view corresponding replies.
Users are also able to change their passwords if they wish to.

### Features for Admins
Admins are able to perform any actions that a regular user is able to do in addition to deleting posts/threads, view all the threads and posts that a user has made, and remove and add user accounts
